Feature: Inspecting HTML tables
  In order to verify that the functionality is correctly implemented
  As a developer for the TableExtension library
  I need to check that the step definitions work as expected

  Scenario: Check if any table on the page matches certain characteristics
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see a table
    And I should see 6 tables

    And I should see a table with 2 columns
    And I should see a table with 3 columns
    And I should see a table with 4 columns
    And I should see a table with 5 columns
    And I should see a table with 6 columns

    And I should see a table with 3 rows
    And I should see a table with 4 rows
    And I should see a table with 5 rows
    And I should see a table with 9 rows

    But I should not see a table with 1 column
    And I should not see a table with 7 columns

    And I should not see a table with 1 row
    And I should not see a table with 2 rows

    Given I am on "no-tables-here.html"
    Then I should not see a table
    And I should not see the simple table
    And I should see 0 tables
    And I should not see a table with 1 column
    And I should not see a table with 2 columns
    And I should not see a table with 1 row
    And I should not see a table with 2 rows

  Scenario: Check if specific tables are displayed correctly
    Given I am on the homepage
